# Required Steps and Elements for a Completed Project

## Identify the important centers of profit and loss for the superstore:
- Among the pairs of dimensions (e.g., subcategory + region, or shipping mode + product ID) which are the two biggest profit centers and two biggest loss-makers? Justify your conclusion with a visualization.
- Which products should the superstore stop selling? Justify your conclusion with a visualization.
- Which product subcategories should the store focus on and which should they stop selling? Choose 3 of each.

## Advertising:
- Find out if adverstising is worth it using average profit per unit
- Identify the 3 best combinations of states and month of the year to advertise in.
- Make a visualization of the average profit for each month of the year for those 3 states and argue how much you would be willing to pay in advertising for those states in those months.

## Returned Items:
- Find out if some products have abnormal rates of being returned to the store.
- Make the Returned field into a calculated field where the null values are 0 and the Yes values are 1.
- Use this new field to make a visualization for each of the following questions: 1. Which products have the highest return rate? 2. Which customers have the highest return rate?
- In a separate sheet, make a visualization of the average profit against the average return rate on a dimension of your choice (state, shipping mode, product type, etc.). Present a visual argument why the superstore should do away with or keep doing business on the basis of this dimension.
