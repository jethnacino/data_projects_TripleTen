#### Description:
- 9 page spreadsheet
- Includes organizational tabs, raw data, processed data, data analysis, pivot tables, and charts. 

#### Process:
**Data Preparation:** Filtering techniques identified and cleaned inconsistencies in the Airbnb data, hiding irrelevant columns for focused analysis. Key functions like PROPER, TRIM, IF, ISNUMBER, FIND, ROUND, SUMIF, VLOOKUP, CHOOSE, and WEEKDAY were used for data cleaning.

**Neighborhood Analysis:** A Pivot Table identified top-performing neighborhoods based on review frequency.

**Property Size Analysis:** Optimal property sizes for each neighborhood were determined using a Pivot Table with conditional formatting.

**Revenue Analysis:** Estimated annual revenue for the most attractive listings was calculated.

**Additional Optional Analysis:** Pivot Tables were used to analyze occupancy rates by day, pricing based on superhost status, check-in ratings with doormen, and pricing by review ratings.

**Data Visualization:** Clear charts were created to present findings.

**Formatting and Organization:** The analysis was formatted for readability.

**Documentation:** Organizational sheets were created, including an executive summary, table of contents, assumptions log, and change log.
