#### Description:
- 9 page spreadsheet
- Includes organizational tabs, raw data, processed data, data analysis, pivot tables, and charts. 

#### Process:
**Data Preparation:** Filtering techniques identified and cleaned inconsistencies in the Airbnb data, hiding irrelevant columns for focused analysis. Key functions like PROPER, TRIM, IF, ISNUMBER, FIND, ROUND, SUMIF, VLOOKUP, CHOOSE, and WEEKDAY were used for data cleaning.

**Neighborhood Analysis:** A Pivot Table identified top-performing neighborhoods based on review frequency.

**Property Size Analysis:** Optimal property sizes for each neighborhood were determined using a Pivot Table with conditional formatting.

**Revenue Analysis:** Estimated annual revenue for the most attractive listings was calculated.

**Additional Optional Analysis:** Pivot Tables were used to analyze occupancy rates by day, pricing based on superhost status, check-in ratings with doormen, and pricing by review ratings.

**Data Visualization:** Clear charts were created to present findings.

**Formatting and Organization:** The analysis was formatted for readability.

**Documentation:** Organizational sheets were created, including an executive summary, table of contents, assumptions log, and change log.

    - `'FIELD NAME'`: DESCRIPTION HERE

#### Assumptions:
- Airbnb rentals are equivalent to the general short-term vacation rental market
- Focus on vacation rentals with a minimum stay of 7 days or fewer.
- Exclude listings with no reviews in the past 12 months, assuming they are active.
- Use the number of reviews in the last 12 months as an estimate of rental frequency.
- Only include listings owned by superhosts with high review ratings.
- Consider only listings with 10 or more reviews in the last 12 months.
- Limit listings to those priced between $100 and $1000.


#### Findings:
-The top 10 neighborhoods with the most reviews in the past year are Nolita, West Village, East Harlem, East Village, Chelsea, Upper West Side, Midtown, Harlem, Hell's Kitchen, and Lower East Side. The most popular vacation rental size is 2 bedrooms, with the highest occupancy rates on Fridays and Saturdays.

#### Recommendations/Results:
- I recommend investing in 2-bedroom listings in the Lower East Side, estimating an annual revenue of $151,803.88.
